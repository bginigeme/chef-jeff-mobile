# Production Readiness Checklist

## âœ… Environment Variables Setup
- [x] OpenAI API key configured in `app.json` extra section
- [x] Environment variables set in `eas.json` for all build profiles
- [x] Fallback logic implemented in `aiRecipeService.ts`
- [x] `expo-constants` properly configured

## ðŸ”§ Pre-Production Tasks

### 1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file should be in .gitignore):
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=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
```

### 2. Security Review
- [ ] Remove hardcoded API key from `app.json` before production
- [ ] Set up environment variables in EAS dashboard instead
- [ ] Review API key permissions and usage limits
- [ ] Ensure no sensitive data is logged in production

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Test image generation in production build
- [ ] Test recipe generation with various pantry items
- [ ] Test error handling (network issues, API limits)
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android devices

### 4. Performance
- [ ] Test app startup time
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Check memory usage during recipe generation
- [ ] Test with slow network connections

### 5. App Store Preparation
- [ ] Update app version in `app.json`
- [ ] Prepare app store screenshots
- [ ] Write app store description
- [ ] Set up app store categories
- [ ] Prepare privacy policy
- [ ] Set up app store connect account

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Steps

### 1. EAS Build Configuration
```bash
# Build for production
eas build --platform all --profile production

# Or build separately
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### 2. Environment Variables in EAS Dashboard
1. Go to your EAS project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your production API key
4. Remove the key from `app.json` and `eas.json` for security

### 3. App Store Submission
```bash
# Submit to app stores
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### For Production:
1. **Never commit API keys to git**
2. **Use EAS dashboard for environment variables**
3. **Rotate API keys regularly**
4. **Monitor API usage and costs**
5. **Set up billing alerts**

### Recommended Changes Before Production:
1. Remove API key from `app.json` extra section
2. Remove API key from `eas.json` env sections
3. Set up environment variables in EAS dashboard only
4. Add error monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
5. Add analytics tracking

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

### Recommended Tools:
- [ ] Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Firebase Analytics for user behavior
- [ ] OpenAI usage monitoring
- [ ] App store analytics

### Key Metrics to Track:
- Recipe generation success rate
- Image generation success rate
- API response times
- User engagement metrics
- Error rates and types

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in code
- [ ] App builds successfully for both platforms
- [ ] App store assets prepared
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service ready
- [ ] API usage limits and billing configured
- [ ] Error handling tested
- [ ] Performance optimized
- [ ] Security review completed

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Note

**BEFORE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:**
1. Remove the API key from `app.json` extra section
2. Remove the API key from `eas.json` env sections  
3. Set up the environment variable ONLY in the EAS dashboard
4. This prevents the API key from being exposed in your source code

Your app is very close to production-ready! The main remaining task is properly securing the environment variables through the EAS dashboard rather than having them in your configuration files.
